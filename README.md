# UNP_PYTHON_PROJECT_WITH_SALARY_DATASET

A salary dataset is a collection of information about employees' salaries and related factors. It typically includes details like employee demographics (age, gender, education), job-related attributes (job title, department, experience, location), and compensation components (base salary, bonuses, total salary). The dataset is used to analyze salary trends, identify factors affecting pay, explore disparities (e.g., gender pay gap), and gather insights about industries or roles offering higher earnings.
